## File Sorter

**How to use:**
> The file sorter can moved to a directory that you want to sort. Then run the file and wait for it to confirm that it has completed sorting.

**How does it work?**

> After it has been moved to the directory that needs to be sorted, it loops through all the files in the directory and adds them to the res array. Then it loops through the array and renames every file to a format based on their index in the array.

**Why was this created?**

> As a photographer you often deal with thousands of photos in just one folder. You need to sort these to be able to manage and reference these images. Therefore I created this small Python script to do that for me.
